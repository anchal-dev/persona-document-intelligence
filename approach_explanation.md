\# Approach Explanation



\## Methodology Overview



Our persona-driven document intelligence system employs a multi-stage pipeline combining semantic understanding with domain-specific ranking to extract and prioritize document sections based on user personas and job requirements.



\## Core Components



1\. \*\*Document Processing\*\*: Utilizes PyPDF2 for text extraction while preserving structural information including page numbers and section hierarchies. Regular expressions identify section boundaries across different document formats.



2\. \*\*Semantic Analysis\*\*: Employs the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer (80MB) for generating embeddings of both document content and persona/job descriptions. This lightweight model provides efficient semantic matching while staying within memory constraints.



3\. \*\*Relevance Scoring\*\*: Implements a weighted scoring system combining:

&nbsp;  - Semantic similarity (40%): Cosine similarity between content and persona embeddings

&nbsp;  - Keyword matching (30%): Domain-specific term alignment

&nbsp;  - Domain relevance (20%): Context-aware scoring based on persona expertise

&nbsp;  - Structural importance (10%): Position-based weighting (introduction, conclusion priority)



4\. \*\*Hierarchical Extraction\*\*: First identifies relevant sections, then performs granular subsection analysis within top-ranked sections to provide detailed insights.



\## Technical Optimizations



\- \*\*CPU Efficiency\*\*: Selected models specifically optimized for CPU inference

\- \*\*Memory Management\*\*: Batch processing and selective caching to stay within 1GB limit

\- \*\*Processing Speed\*\*: Parallel section analysis and optimized text preprocessing for <60s execution

\- \*\*Generalization\*\*: Template-based approach handles diverse document types and personas without domain-specific hardcoding



The system balances accuracy with performance constraints while maintaining generalizability across varied use cases.
